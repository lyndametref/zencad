        <h2 id="- 1"> Geometric core.
            <h2><p> The zencad library is based on the OpenCascade geometry core. To work with OpenCascade, a thin layer
                <a href="https:github.commirmikservoce"> servoce </a> is used, which defines a small number of basic
                objects, operations on them and uses pybind11 to create an API on the python side. Almost all
                functions of the Python API of the servoce library release the interpreter GIL, which allows you to
                work with the state of python at the time of geometry rendering. </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 id="zencad-2"> Organization and interaction of threads and ZenCad processes. </h2>
                <p> ZenCad's graphical interface is designed in such a way as to have a minimum effect on the
                    order of calculations in the scripts being run. In order to achieve this, the scripts are called
                    in a separate process, infected by invoking the operating system command line (see <code>
                        zencadguiapplication.md </code>, <code> zencad.gui.__main__.py </code>). Communication between
                    processes is carried out through posix channels (or their analogs). Dependent processes read
                    messages from stdin and send messages through stdout. The console output of dependent
                    processes is intercepted by the pipe system and sent to the controlling process with a
                    special marker, so that it, in turn, will display this message on the console. Since the
                    resulting console output system is quite complex and requires debugging in itself, debug
                    information is sent to stderr, not stdout. Debug output is activated with the <em> --debug
                    </em> key. </p>
                <p> There are two schemes for launching the graphical user interface. </p>
                <p> In the first case, the graphical interface is launched directly by using the commands
                    (<code> zencad </code>, <code> python3 -m zencad </code>). Here the GUI is the root process. </p>
                <p> In the second case, the graphical user interface is created by the show () function, from
                    the python script interpreter process. In this case, the graphical user interface is a
                    spawned root process and, for example, to work with console output, redirects the output of
                    all generated scripts to the root process. The root process is not destroyed until the GUI
                    finishes, even if another file was opened in the interface. </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 id="- 2"> Sleep optimization. </h2>
                <p> The python interpreter, alas, has property to load for a rather long time (up to
                    several seconds), which somewhat worsens the responsiveness of the system, since each
                    recalculation of the model is performed in ZenCad in a new process. </p>
                <p> To somewhat smooth out this factor, dormant optimization was introduced. The system
                    pre-loads and hibernates the python process, which can then be quickly used to
                    execute the next script. As soon as the previous sleeping process is used, a new one
                    is created in its place. </p>
                <p> Sleep optimization can be disabled using the --no-sleeped switch </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 id="- 3"> Window embedding. </h2>
                <p><em> ZenCad </em> uses the embeddable window mechanism to display the
                    graphical output of processes in the interface of the main window. </p>
                <p> Disable window embedding is performed with the --no-embed key </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 id="-4"> Start a process from the GUI. </h2>
                <p> When starting a process from the GUI, zencad does some preliminary
                    work. </p>
                <p> Here is an incomplete list: - Changes the behavior of the show
                    function (see below) - Intercepts the output to stdout, redirects it
                    to the parent process. - Subscribes to notifications from the
                    caching library to display the progress of the calculation. </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 id="show"> Function show. </h2>
                <p> Depending on the context, the show function can change its
                    behavior (see <code> zencadshowapi.py </code>). </p>
                <p> If the process is started by the user from the console, the
                    show function spawns the application process, and then
                    constructs the render window, which notifies the application
                    process. </p>
                <p> If the process is spawned by the zencad application, the
                    show function constructs the render window, and then
                    notifies the process applications.</p>
